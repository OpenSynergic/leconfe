## Contributing ü§ù

Thank you for considering contributing to Leconfe! Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

### Structure and Maintanability

-   Avoid adding new dependencies unless absolutely necessary.
-   Use the `__()` helper function instead of hardcoding translations.
-   Each Eloquent model should have a sensible [Database Factory](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/database-testing#factories).
-   Use [Queued Jobs](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/queues) to perform long-running tasks. Notify users that a task is running.
-   Use [Notifications](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/notifications) to send emails to users, or a [Mailable](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/mail) when it's unimaginable that a notification would be sent to anything other than the mail channel.
-   Prefer enums over constants.

### Security and Performance

-   Encrypt all sensitive data in Eloquent models.
-   Each Eloquent model should have a corresponding [Policy](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/authorization#creating-policies) to handle authorization.
-   Each Eloquent model should have a corresponding [Resource](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/eloquent-resources) to handle serialization.
-   All actions should be Logged.
-   Always use pagination on index pages.
-   The following Eloquent protections are enabled by default
    -   Prevent Lazy Loading to avoid N+1 queries
    -   Require a morph map when using polymorphic relations
